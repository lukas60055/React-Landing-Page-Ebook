## About the project

A simple landing page that I coded in React based on an Adobe Photoshop project. The project mainly used classes from Bootstrap 5. Also, I used an external function to parse the text so that the text retrieved from a JSON file that contained HTML tags would display well on the page.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
